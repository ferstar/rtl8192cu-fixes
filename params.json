{"name":"Rtl8192cu-fixes","tagline":"Realtek 8192 chipset driver, ported to kernel 3.11 or above","body":"This is a port of Realtek's own 8192CU driver for USB WiFi devices on Ubuntu 13.10 and later.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nEnsure you have the necessary prerequisites installed:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install git linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential dkms\r\n\r\nClone this repository:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/ferstar/rtl8192cu-fixes.git\r\n\r\nChange branch to raspberry:\r\n\r\n    git checkout raspberry\r\n\r\nSet it up as a DKMS module:\r\n\r\n    sudo dkms add ./rtl8192cu-fixes\r\n\r\nBuild and install it(add `--force` if you have previous installed the driver from other place:) ):\r\n\r\n    sudo dkms install 8192cu/1.10 --force\r\n\r\nRefresh the module list:\r\n\r\n    sudo depmod -a\r\n\r\nEnsure the native (and broken) kernel driver is blacklisted:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp ./rtl8192cu-fixes/blacklist-native-rtl8192.conf /etc/modprobe.d/\r\n\r\nAnd reboot. You're done.\r\n\r\nOther distributions\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThe instructions above should work in every Debian-based distribution. So long as you can install the prerequisites on your own, everything after the line that contains `apt-get` should work in other distributions as well.\r\n\r\nOn Gentoo, you can disregard the instructions above and just install the following ebuild: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/dev/maksbotan.git/tree/sys-kernel/rtl8192cu-fixes/rtl8192cu-fixes-9999.ebuild\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue with power management on some hardware. If your WiFi connection drops after a few minutes, install the following module setting file to disable power management in your WiFi interface:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp ./rtl8192cu-fixes/8192cu-disable-power-management.conf /etc/modprobe.d/\r\n\r\nAnd then reboot.\r\n\r\nCurrent status\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, the driver doesn't populate /proc with informational data from the driver. The API for /proc has changed in recent kernels, and the driver hasn't yet been ported to the new API.\r\n\r\nThis driver is known to work with some RTL8192CU devices like the Belkin N300 and TP-Link TL-WN823N, and should work with some 8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU and RTL8188RU devices as well. However, it is known not to work well with devices using dual antennas, such as the TP-Link WN8200ND, apparently due to an incomplete MIMO implementation in the upstream driver.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis repository was initially based on Timothy Phillips's work as published here: https://code.google.com/p/realtek-8188cus-wireless-drivers-3444749-ubuntu-1304/, though no longer.\r\n\r\nThanks go to Saqib Razaq (@s-razaq) for the power management workaround.\r\n\r\nAddition\r\n=======\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove this driver package someday:\r\n\r\n    sudo dkms remove -m 8192cu/1.10 --all\r\n    sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu-disable-power-management.conf\r\n    sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-native-rtl8192.conf\r\n\r\nAnd reboot. You're done.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
